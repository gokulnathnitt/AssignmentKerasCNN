## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
	This project is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.
- What is the background of your project?
	I have built a CNN model to detect the Melanoma from the different image.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
	Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
	We use the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset to train and test the images

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
	Initial CNN model without dropout had overfitting
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
	After adding dropout, it improved slightly the training and validation accuracy.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
	After adding the Augmentation, both training and validation accuracy went above 90%
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
